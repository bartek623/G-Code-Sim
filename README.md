# GCode Simulator

## Description
A complex project that draws two-dimensional lines on a flat XZ plane from a given program written in GCODE.
It simulates how the tool of a CNC machine moves with a given program.
3D models can be extruded from the created lines as it would be a lathing operation, that also can be downloaded to a .stl file.
Programs can be saved and stored in the browser's local storage or to .JSON file so later it can be uploaded.
Lines of programs can be auto-numbered according to the N-code standard.
