# GCode Simulator

Simple project that draws two dimensional lines on flat XY plane from given program written in GCODE.
It simulates how tool of CNC machine moves with given program.

## TODO

- Prepare 3D canvas ✅
- Implement camera controls ✅
- Prepare drawer with text area for gcode ✅
- Interprete gcode to data about lines (type, coords of ending, center of arc etc.) ✅
- Create better validation of gcode 🚧
- Draw lines on 2D plane ✅
- Create drawer to save/load program (for now it can be local storage) ✅
- Create snackbar with appropriate notifications (e.g. on program save, errors etc.) ✅
- Error handling ✅
- Extrude model with given lines (by rotation around X axis) ✅
- Find way to extrude concave model 🐛
- Add unit tests
- Create option to import/export model (e.g. .step file)
- Create simple documentation
- Import aliases
